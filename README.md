Capstone Project: Exploring Global Terrorism Tactics
Overview
This project aims to explore trends and patterns in global terrorism tactics using data from the Global Terrorism Database. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of terrorist attacks, the severity of incidents, and the factors influencing terrorist activities across different regions.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which provides comprehensive information on terrorist incidents worldwide. The dataset includes various attributes such as the location, date, type of attack, target type, weapons used, and casualty counts.

Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Terrorist activities are the same in all regions.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Terrorist activities are worse in some regions.
Hypothesis 2:
Null Hypothesis (H0): Terrorist risks are the same in all regions.
Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Terrorist risks are higher in some regions.
Methodology
Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Cleaned the dataset to focus on relevant attributes and filter data for the specified time period.
Visualized top countries by the number of attacks and types of attacks.
Examined the number of attacks over time and fatalities by country.
Statistical Analysis:
Conducted chi-square tests to evaluate the association between the type of attack and region.
Performed ANOVA to compare the severity of attacks across different regions.
Predictive Modeling:
Utilized logistic regression to predict the success of terrorist attacks based on various factors.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Key Findings
The chi-square test results suggest a significant relationship between the type of attack and the region, indicating regional variations in terrorist tactics.
ANOVA results reveal differences in the severity of attacks across regions, with certain regions experiencing higher fatality rates.
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 89.78% in predicting the success of terrorist attacks, with better performance in predicting positive outcomes.
Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the distribution, severity, and predictive factors of global terrorism tactics. Regional factors play a significant role in shaping the nature and prevalence of terrorist incidents, highlighting the importance of understanding localized trends for effective counterterrorism strategies.
